# Tic-Tac-Toe

---

I just came out of working along the [official React tutorial](htpps://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe), and I have been feeling it could be done more efficiently. This is when I fount out about
[![Redux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reduxjs/redux/master/logo/logo-title-dark.png 'Redux')](https://redux.js.org/)

So now I try to make a serious independent tic-tac-toe, learning and simultaneously using Redux from their official [resources](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start).

I also intend to build it so that it conforms to Google's [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps) specifications.
